        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="description">
            Being on a diet, the words creamy and pasta usually are reserved for
            only my cheat days. I wanted to make something and not feel guilty
            about eating it, so I whipped this up in the kitchen. It's delicious
            and very adaptable; change it up however you like! Has a nice little
            bite with the red pepper flakes added. This would also be fantastic
            with onion added.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package whole wheat penne pasta</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cubed</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can fat-free cream of mushroom soup</li>
            <li>Â½ cup water, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 pinch garlic salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Direction</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Step 1 <br />Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and
                bring to a boil. Stir in penne and return to a boil. Cook pasta
                uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but still
                firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain.
            </li>
            <li>
                Step 2 <br />Cook and stir olive oil and garlic in a large
                skillet over high heat just until brown and fragrant, about 2
                minutes. Add chicken and mushrooms; stir to coat with garlic and
                olive oil. Cook chicken until no longer pink in the center and
                the juices run clear, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in cream of mushroom
                soup; gradually add 1/2 cup of water about 1 tablespoon at a
                time, adding enough to make sauce light and creamy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Step 3 <br />Reduce heat to medium-low heat and gently fold
                pasta into the chicken and sauce until coated. Add garlic salt
                and red pepper to taste; remove from heat and serve.
            </li>
        </ul>
